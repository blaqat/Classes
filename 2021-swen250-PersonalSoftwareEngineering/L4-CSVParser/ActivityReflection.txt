WEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:Aiden Green

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	01:30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I will just go in order of the functions listed in the file from the download and then
test using the test file to check for errors and things not working correctly
Complete
Actual Time	03:3
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I forgot to null verify the strings so I kept getting weird results so I rewrote the same functional code 20 times. After I figured it out it took 20 minutes to do the rest...
