# P5-SignalCapture

## Description:
This is a small addition to P4-SignalGenerator that adds the ability to capture signals generated by a function generator. The signals are captured using the ADC peripheral of the STM32F4 Discovery board when using the `cap` command. The captured signals are then able to be played back as a waveform using `c` waveform in the `gen` command.
