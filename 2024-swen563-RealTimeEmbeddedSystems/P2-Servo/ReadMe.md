# P2-Servo

## Description
This project is a simple servo motor controller that uses the PWM peripheral of the STM32F4 Discovery board to control the position of a servo motor. The project allows control of 2 servero motors to play back saved recipies.
- The project aims to create a real-time “concurrent” system performs a set of different commands on two servo “simultaneously” also allowing for terminal commands to do different things.
