# P4-SignalGenerator

## Description:
This project is a simple signal generator that generates sine, square, triangle, and ekg waves using the DAC peripheral of the STM32F4 Discovery board. The generated signals can be played back as a waveform using the `gen` command.
- This project is to demonstrate being able to generate waveforms through a DAC
